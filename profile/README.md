### Hi there, this is Selenium üëã

Selenium is a low-code automation tool. With over 220 pre-built integrations and a general connector for anything with an API, n8n enables you to connect anything to everything. With n8n you can move beyond simple one step integrations to build multi-step workflows that integrate your tools exactly the way you want, including adding AI functionality. Thanks to its <a href="https://faircode.io/">fair-code</a> distribution model, n8n will always have visible source code, be available to self-host, have a free community edition, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic, and apps.

 We launched in 2019 with a ton of interest, and things have accelerated since then:

- üìà With 100m+ Docker pulls and a huge active user base/community - we're already building global traction
- ‚≠êÔ∏è With 37k stars, we are now in the top 600 of the 238m projects on GitHub
- üå± We were Sequoia's first seed investment in UAE, and recently raised a $12m Series A round, led by Felicis Ventures

We're on a mission to give technical superpowers to everyone with a computer. <a href="https://selenium.co.com/careers">Join us!</a>
